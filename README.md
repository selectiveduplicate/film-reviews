# graphql-filmReviews

Building on the [previous app](https://github.com/selectiveduplicate/graphql-filmquery), this app explores how we can use [custom queries](https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/custom/directive/#calling-graphql-custom-resolvers) in GraphQL schema to request data from a [remote server](https://play.dgraph.io/) to use. Essentially, it demonstrates how an app could work that combines remote data and user-supplied data, saving the final result in the app's own database after processing.

## Tools used
* [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/) as backend
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) as GraphQL client
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for the UI.
